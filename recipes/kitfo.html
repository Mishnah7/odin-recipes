        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from raw minced beef, seasoned with spices and clarified butter. It is often served with a side of greens and is a popular choice for special occasions.</p>
        <p>This dish is known for its rich flavor and is typically enjoyed with injera, a sourdough flatbread that complements the taste of the meat.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> raw minced beef (preferably lean)</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> clarified butter (niter kibbeh)</li>
            <li><strong>1-2 tablespoons</strong> mitmita (Ethiopian spice blend)</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> chopped fresh greens (like gomen or collard greens) for serving</li>
            <li><strong>Injera</strong> (Ethiopian flatbread) for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Niter Kibbeh:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you don't have niter kibbeh, you can make it by melting unsalted butter and adding spices like garlic, ginger, and cardamom. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, then strain.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mix the Beef:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine the raw minced beef with the clarified butter. Mix well to ensure the beef is coated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add Spices:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add mitmita and salt to the beef mixture. Adjust the amount of mitmita based on your spice preference. Mix thoroughly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traditionally, Kitfo is served raw, but you can lightly sear it in a pan if you prefer it cooked.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Kitfo on a plate with a side of chopped greens and injera.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use pieces of injera to scoop up the Kitfo and greens.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mitmita</strong> is a spicy Ethiopian chili powder. If you can't find it, you can substitute with a mix of cayenne pepper and other spices.</li>
            <li><strong>Niter Kibbeh</strong> can be purchased at Ethiopian grocery stores or made at home.</li>
            <li>Kitfo can also be served with a side of ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese) for a milder flavor.</li>
        </ul>
